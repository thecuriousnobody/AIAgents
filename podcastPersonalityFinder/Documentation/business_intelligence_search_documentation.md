# Versatile Business Intelligence Search System Documentation

## Overview
Created on August 12, 2025, this system transforms the podcast guest finder technology into a versatile business intelligence platform that can handle various types of business searches.

## System Architecture

### Core Functionality
The system automatically detects query intent and configures appropriate agent teams:
- **Problem-solving searches**: 4 agents (Analyzer → Finder → Validator → Strategist)
- **Trend analysis**: 3 agents (Researcher → Impact Analyst → Adoption Strategist)
- **Resource finding**: 2 agents (Locator → Evaluator)
- **Compliance searches**: 3 agents (varies by need)

### Key Features
- Auto-detects search intent from natural language queries
- Generates professional markdown reports with executive summaries
- Provides validated solutions with ROI data, not just marketing claims
- Includes ready-to-use email templates and contact information
- Saves 10-20 hours of manual research per query

## Technical Notes

### Query Analysis Logic
```python
# System detects intent based on keywords
- "find", "help", "solutions" → problem_solving
- "trends", "emerging", "latest" → trend_analysis  
- "suppliers", "vendors", "sources" → resource_finding
- "compliance", "regulations" → compliance
```

### Agent Configuration
Each query type dynamically configures different agent teams with specialized roles and tools, ensuring optimal results for the specific search intent.
