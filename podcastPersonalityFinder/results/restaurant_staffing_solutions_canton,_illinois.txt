Subject: Urgent Staffing Relief for [Restaurant Name] - Same-Day Coverage Available

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name] from [Restaurant Name] in Canton, Illinois. Like many restaurants, we're struggling with:
- Last-minute call-outs leaving us short-staffed during peak hours
- Difficulty finding experienced hospitality workers quickly
- Overtime costs spiraling due to skeleton crews

I saw Qwick helped Beatitudes Campus go from 50 positions short to fully staffed. We need similar results - can you fill shifts within 24 hours in our market?

Specific questions:
- Do you have pre-vetted servers and kitchen staff available in Central Illinois?
- What's your typical fill rate for same-day requests?
- Can you provide 2-3 references from similar-sized restaurants?

We're ready to move quickly if this can solve our immediate staffing crisis.

Best regards,
[Your Name], [Title]

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Inability to provide local references
