User Input: Okay, I have a new work activity. We are going to do a demo at the Discovery Labs middle of next month. And for the demo, I need to submit a bunch of details to my coordinator in order for me to demonstrate to her that this is workshop is going to be a demo heavy workshop. And we are going to demo certain AI features applied in real world scenarios and things like that. So, yeah, if you could help me kind of assign an activity for me to submit the initial application that we fantastic and maybe the next week, we could try to start working on the demonstration directly.
