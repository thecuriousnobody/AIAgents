for some reason your mute your mic shows it's muted  I can hear you now Google can I see what is dr. Gary Miller  okay thanks again for doing this I'm so looking forward to doing this just give me one second here and you see if I could swap so that way I'm not looking so far away from you I'm recording by the way just letting you know  let's see tile  July 8th  okay I just if you don't care I don't care is it okay if I'm looking sort of like that cuz you all thank you for doing this get on then I appreciate you doing this is very close to my heart and I will I will not put you through introducing yourself or anything like that because I'll do all the post-production in Atlanta all this stuff and I'm I'm actually planning this to be a little bit different than my usual podcast where I usually will just start with the conversation or give a little rough pmbull in this case I think I want to kind of  unilad some context and detail before we actually show the conversation and maybe select some part of the conversation to kind of emphasize certain points so so yeah I won't put you through that. So if you don't mind can I get right into it okay first of all how did you get into this field research could I like you so you know WhatsApp University if you don't mind me using that word I guess I'll stick to what happened versity today or Whatsapp today not Twitter so much maybe we can talk much with her to what motivated you to get into this research what brought you to the space and you know I was doing a lot of work on studying things like in a political polarization in the US  usual stuff like with the Twitter data that everyone was doing and this was back in 2017 2018 when you know these ideas of like misinformation to go to the US especially about just picking up let you know okay misinformation research has been done for a long while but you know especially after brexit in all of these like in the US make academic an interesting message from maesha of the topic like really skyrocketed there's a lot of this being a lot of interest in the space and that was when let you know one of those Summers I was in India and I think it was the summer of 2017 when it was totally a Spate of incidents of like offline Weiland's making of rumors about child kidnapping killing people like real violence and lynchings in a text like that I S this was just a very short duration around like 30 to 40 people  Kim and many many people were injured like so in this is in Vegas part of India all across India and the root cause of this was just one rumor about one video about in all your children are being kidnapped by strangers coming to your village be careful right after that was the rumor that is pending and anyone who entered the village just was you know at acting like wildfire and that you don't really got me thinking about like looking at whatsapp be okay I'll just leave when you let me work on WhatsApp because you know. Really that's widely used to hear the US and Eric most Academia like really just looks a little bit which is much more easier to get to a dual real reasons one is just selfish reason that you know this is a new platform like new  you interesting Insight sourcing the job has won the other than just you know this sort of like online information didn't do offline consequences that's a really new idea but I can back there was some talk about 7 years ago. Just just to give you some context recent thing happened that people would not care about misinformation as as as an offline consequence right thing so people would say yes but online consumption leading to offline activity happened in India and many many places in a quite a bit but the dark consider this as a big threat until you know I just saw John 6 2021 happen  but yeah these are the two of the reasons why I got into this around 2018 or so  yeah I mean I might also want to add to the conversation I have seen very personal effect of this kid on his that you know I've seen my parents relationship between themselves for example my parents relationship with dear friend Circle my my very close friends and if they ever going to watch this they might I might get some hate but but but it's a real thing right like where you know religious polarisation really just messaging like like one of the things you said 82% one of the reasons I went through all of your papers and some of the statistics were like mind-blowing were even after being debunked they get we shared and things like that and  and even a relative Circle  my cousins and my uncles and so forth it goes on to this very day right at get that happening today information that's just manufacturer to arouse your emotions manufacturer to get you to vote won versus the other way and so on so this is a person to me is I guess my point and I guess I want to dive right into it like what can be done about this kid on exit out a bunch of research stuff practically speaking can you can walk through you know let's say you know from a technical perspective that start with that you know let's play some entrepreneurs wanted to do a startup or a technology or a plug-in or some kind of software what can't I mean of course I'll put links to the papers and stuff like what can be done from a height of 30,000 ft few  I'll just give you some context of like why this is a very difficult problem particularly for WhatsApp 60 this internet connection on WhatsApp because of which two what what that means is just simplify life I send you a message if I sent you a message on Facebook you know if I sent you a picture of a cat Facebook no okay send a message to be and it's a picture of a cat on WhatsApp picture Facebook on WhatsApp just know that I sent you a picture but they don't know what is it could just be a cat picture or it could be a hater video so you don't know what is the content of the information that is spreading on the platform that is a huge problem in moderating any sort of contact list on Facebook princess the Facebook platform you have a lot of  creators who can cut it as flag and the Margaritas look at that and say okay this is hp's this information this is one word for false information and they can flirt like they have a bunch of stuff that used to work with that WhatsApp is no such infrastructure is this this is internet option provides privacy but nobody is able to look at any of your personal conversations is that is a solid point on WhatsApp so we have that you know they're saying okay you know we don't want to look at your content we don't want to do any sort of person that's one in the other end of the spectrum is the cases of examples that I told you that this particular video was causing riots in all these Villages across India how did the people of being injured but WhatsApp cannot  do anything what does not want to do anything about it today is you really are opposing ends of the spectrum this is the problem with privacy is a good thing we don't want to break into certain governments of India and Australia government they have cases are they saying you know you know what time is being misused for child sexual exploitation right now so you have to take a shower in these cases and it's usually you you are giving like a password you can get access to anything you just said you can all just say I only give you access to tee times and you still so what can be done so that there is  what the platform can do in terms of the levels of the platform has in designing Solutions and WhatsApp has done a decent enough job here like for instance they've introduced friction in reducing the spread of information I think so no one thing you can do is you know if a piece of content has been forwarded many times that you know I will introduce pictures to make sure that this is not in a massively forwarded over and over again and the content has been forwarded more than five hops from the original sender then you cannot forward it more than one person at a time that you don't it doesn't really solve the problem description and we have some work that shows that this really slows down the spread of the information  buy an audit of time to look so you know if it would take note $100 previously to spread the some information and I'll take a thousand or so if that's if that's a really significant about the change of time they called long it takes for information display that's a very good letter what the problem is like especially given how invested actors are the greatest actors of political parties concerned in this game I like so you know especially you know there's this research on the mighty swords were also some other work by The Washington Post Offices in India that shows that just one political party in India has like 100,000 people in one state working on social media activity most of it is. What if you have 100,000 people just sitting and forward in content or creating content they can just keep doing it right the one at a time there's nothing stopping him from stopping them from  they can eventually spread their their information so it's not a complete solution but it is one solution they said they started forwarding limits are a good solution to a majority of Lake 99.999% of WhatsApp is not people from political parties it's people like you and me who using it normally we don't have any malicious intent to spread this rumor part of a particularly effective to a large extent but it is not a solution for certain types like so if this propaganda or this information or hate these kind of things which a certain political party that I could want to spend that is not going to solve this problem so that's a top-down solution this very limited top down  what the platform can do that that's one thing that WhatsApp has done very well that's good the other is in terms of more bottom up Solutions which is what did you just can't do I fix the door what do users can themselves two and one solution there that again what type of experimental quite a bit and invested in spent a lot of money on is just bitched illiteracy 360 to help people know and I think you know this podcast one example of wedding you know exactly what it is. I don't know if it's the arouses your emotions like it's most likely to be possible to make sure that people don't forward the information but it's hard to do during the elections and they play today  it's also not a long-term solution the other thing that they are doing is definitely stinks cuz tip lines I don't know if you've heard of these these are just not line numbers is a WhatsApp numbers that a lot of fact checking agencies in India have and if you get any misinformation that say I get to the Telugu I can forward it to Telugu tip line that song by a specific fact checking on message but the reality of these again there's a lot of money that's being spent on these to maintain this applies to this technology to make sure these two blinds work and or pay for the fact-checking efforts are going to this but the truth is just the skin leprosy step lines open it is very very very smart like so WhatsApp is so big so fast in India over 50  messages are sent every day. That's the scale of what's up and I was working with something flying like that was done during the last election 2019 election and the scale was like around 100,000 messages that we got to that pipeline in 3 months so I texted you during the election period and team has a 100,000 messages. All those messages might look like a lot on the thousand but if you look at the overall scheme if you are you you're you're talking of them are two methods do artifacts again I like your heart attacks and most likely the people who consume misinformation people like my mom I might get all my time and they don't know if this right now  they don't even know that okay this could be misinformation let me ask this fact-checking pipeline whatever he just does not skin and so okay so I told you like these two examples I wanted to talk down fiction okay. What's the star next send the others about them up like this illiteracy got a thing that also works to some extent does not work fully what else have you trying not to let me know where we're trying other Solutions like a variance of these days to live to see kind of like that help in scaling up your understanding of people like so for instance you can one thing we realized our research is a lot of the misinformation like around 40% of it can be very easily old misinformation that has already been fractured that is just we shared and respray device to this child  rumor got started I know 10 years ago even if today if you open WhatsApp it will be really spreading why don't you see if you can provide tools that enable the collection of this video or this image has already been fractured easily they can be made that happen like that whatever tools you can provide to enable users to connect fracture content to misinformation Rec information that people to see I think that's an easy solution to the user but you have some sort of technology that enables the sound a matching between Factor content and wanted the people to see I think that's an easy solution that is okay too. This is a project that could be a solution to be trying out Solutions like that but yeah  it's not easy so yeah so can you speak a little bit about that is it on new phone I know one of the papers you mentioned that it kind of localized fact-checking database you have on your phone and you can sort of you know be filter out messages or at least flag it for you is that what you're referring to see out the solution. Be proposed air is in a it's a it's a picture instead of having you can have her a small database on your phone of hashes of you know images videos and text that was already factored you don't even have to have all the videos and images you can just compress them and represent them as harsh as this is very very small I could be in one megabyte for a thousands of images and videos of  and and you can do very efficiently check like okay is this your if I get an image that is this image in this database or not this can be done on the device you showing you know that this works efficiently and you can detect a lot of misinformation that's where they do personal becomes Rob so you can prevent a lot of the smell of the information just by making surely do this after we go. Paper is okay this is technically possible but this is practically a very contentious has a lot of attention especially from the Privacy Advocates on this so the issue there like so the discussion came out after a few interviews. Was trying to do some of these kinds of same kind of foods which they work on device but they scan your gallery for child sex abuse material  if there's a match than they departed to the authorities kind of thing and there was a lot of discussion Apple actually back to act like I'm not doing it. Criminology later. Maybe this 5000 1% of all the population is has this other content like a little child sex abuse farting but now he is planning everyone phone and matching it with your database so how do we guarantee that you know you don't inject some sort of like a garden that you know maybe in India or in some other countries will ask you to inject some sort of Benin video like Trump getting shot or like you're biting falling down the stairs. They don't want anyone to see and they will be able to identify okay you know all these people have this on their phone right EXO how do you make sure that this database that your tree  centrally the Jordan shipping to the phone is foolproof like so that is very hard problem like how do you ensure that if you never it will never ever have anything other than you know the details of child sex abuse material are windows or Microsoft is scanning your your computer all the time for what pain you have one other stuff you have that's not that's not what we want to live in a by Aldi's privacy Advocates I really believe that yeah that may not be the best solution for that that we should think of his condition I guess what I'm hearing is that this is an ongoing  challenging we just have to I'm a technical perspective we just have to keep  trying our best  designing better algorithms and better ways to educate people and is really no airtight solution at the end of the day variants of dark Lake where you know if you can again like this is very practical like they're like I said like a lot of misinformation is very easy to do but many people may not have the tools to do it but you know what you think of you know your local network like so maybe my mom does not have the capability to the bank all the misinformation that she gets but I'm in her network and I have the tools to just reverse image search Google search to specific set of keyboards and trust me more than she was someone in the network is capable of doing this I'm some sort of very local basic tasks.  enable Lakeside chicken to deploy some of those in a way that you can recruit people in the network and try to get some sort of information about their receiving and can you cut this out of misinformation locally without having to send it to songs of the central fact Checker the other lot of work going on this picture yeah so I think the follow-up to that is the second part of it that was my question was still in one hand of God Technical Solutions you got research are in the folks like yourself are working on that but I'm a social cultural perspective so you know a lot of times I I look at the messages being forwarded to me it's just confirmation bias right like this there was already a pre-existing going to believe her notion about a certain group of people  you receive content it looks legitimate to you and it's like see I told you this is actually going on so to me it's like the old the the you know Saturday  this also amplifies this right like you, that's a hard no problem to fix how do you fix you know where people are more diligent about looking at their data are diligent about that stuff because I mean WhatsApp and digital proliferation is a relatively new thing in India right leg and then they've got a mass illiteracy that's because that problem compounding on all of this so it's like have you ever thought about these kind of social cultural issues and how we tackle that are only five  people who are willing to listen and feasible and information particularly a lot of it like it's letting you know 80% of it is behind this information just you know okay drink hot water and you to cure your throat whatever the child has been kidnapped. Maybe maybe I'm part of a group swear this is blatant hate stuff you do at 82 is pretty incessant like I open up I was up in the morning when I wake up that the first sort of thing I do catch up with all the stuff that has happened in India and it's it's a queue of a glitter Lee 40 50 messages of just like 80 I mean it like you said 80% of it is just you know just read me thrown at you write like  and it's like these are educated people these are folks who went to college got a degree in business of whatever I T and all of these things it's a it's not a in my opinion is eating a person experience and Magnolia speaking this manifesting in awful ways people breaking off Ty's relationship is getting freed and think like that experience as my default my queen has a similar like you know most of this information I get is very clean like you're politically oriented politically motivated and do things of behaviors and beliefs are extremely hard to change if you tell someone whose ex party supporter to say you know do you know you are not go to work very very hard thing to change. Do you know may change that the long-term I think  but what was the reasons you're thinking of our only for this order more softer kind of misinformation which is not based on let you know where people have to you please email opinions and do I descale a WhatsApp even solving that like maybe at 80% maybe 60% maybe it's 20%. Scale a large problem that's how I think about it definitely you know there's significant people have pee made their opinion and I guess this is a much more sister makes much more societal kind of issue but then again maybe the solution do it just like we're in for some of these problems I was just more of a top-down bushmaker I know one individual person like if they can come out and say you know what this is  w w e stand for all this is not you can change my opinion just based on one leader one guy one person one entity saying something right as those kinds of things or even even like prioritize in critical thinking education and in primary school could be  a pretty good solution I think that's something that has to be like yeah you know that just ignores a lot of this are Lost Generation like yeah your friends my friends my family your family got a thing where they're still looking at these beliefs are so dependent  yeah earlier mentioned the political parties in or having anxiety cells and things like that and I guess I mean these parties are very open about it that I raised in about it right like they they have a i d c  you know head honcho who speaks in public and things like that has porta potties have this stuff is that I mean what what is your opinion about that whole thing where you know these these i t cells are generating content to throw red meat at you two rows of your emotions and so on if it's bleeding really mean to do something like well this is illegal is that too much of an overreach legal over age or what is your opinion on that other thing there's no clear causal link between you know your social media presence and I'll come straight and some not lawn significant amount of ethics for sure  maybe I've been doing this very very large-scale WhatsApp data collection with monitoring thousands of WhatsApp lose most of them are just no problems if he counted but similarly you have had like multiple instances of this when you thinking about planning on any regulation or any of these things we don't really have evidence that shows that you're having this very popular producer all of this content merely makes up makes a difference really okay so I was thinking there's a fairly easy way to work I mean earlier you mentioned that example where this one video circulated and there was riots and there was the outcomes of being negative and mean you could probably Drive some kind of control  about right similar conclusion this cause this is not just a social media especially in a country like India social media still you know the people on social media but not Justin social media do you still have the TV you still have offline saw a bunch of other sources is very hard I can't let you know you could see the results we have data from most of the Vital Information the most of the content that is forwarded many times a WhatsApp significantly changed it was probably JP 50/50 right parties are people SP your Congress and their strategy was that in a social media is too.  it's too hard to maintain especially at scale lake so you can have a $0.90 but if you have to constantly keep creating content and constantly create content that engages people that's a very big expense rather spend that on offline campaigning door-to-door reaching out to people giving money to people like your other modes that I pay more bang for the buck it's completely clear. You know this place off maybe it does in the long-term right like I said that's what you were talking about maybe over the 15 years in social media has existed like the strategies and the kinds of content and narratives that this one party has created they don't know if I have some ups and downs here and there but that's what an additive mighty early you know it is now in India and we all know no longer like that 15 years ago you could not have said some things but now you can say those things  watch more openly because you know maybe social media conversations are normalized some of these people feel okay to say some of these may not that I don't think it's very clear that you are really has an effect yeah I mean to the point like the Overton window could be shifted constantly right by if you're constantly bombarding kind of one kind of information to your constituents you could clearly shifted they made it out of the direct cause-and-effect sort of thing but over the period of time like you said and that's what I'm observing anyway because I you know Prix 2015 I think it's worth mentioning that most of my friends I would speak to wear like a moderate spectrum of beliefs and I was like okay in those Muslims Christine's whatever is all of this stuff posted if you don't accept it as part of Indian life this was just in a Multicultural Society  blah blah blah but then as you've seen in pain as I've seen in 10 years since 2015 it's pretty clear that the Overton window shifted like it's it's even though the facts don't you know reflect that on the ground the attitudes have changed you know it's like the moment something happens you just lunch to this one conclusion that this must live group must have you know down there so or that anyway I think we agree on that  I guess I use a personal question for you can you use you studied in India you did you get your PhD in Finland in Europe and then you did a postdoc in MIT end and things like that so all your you kind of spend a lot of time in all of these three continents what have you seen from a societal perspective from the cultural perspective that makes certain groups of people susceptible to misinformation  yeah yeah that's very very interesting  I mean there is there is research that talks about the types of people who are susceptible to this information or to conspiracy theories and narratives and things like that so I mean it depends on the on the contacts in the types of narratives to take the car back but I think overall she was an important population that says it's not not much I think some of my work in the face and some other people in the US like even recently profiled in a large-scale studies that show that you know most of this information older people who are on the right end table  I forgot you don't have a certain type of belief system and this isn't the us or in general in the US these groupings have a certain common phenomena one is okay lack of digital literacy lately to the older Generations may not have had as much exposure like it when you talk to them coming onto this Medium as as I know someone was a bit more younger whose importance to native roots has seen some of these like you've totally against this is one of the reasons why it's a big problem in India is because you know of that sodden introduction of social media a lot of that digital literacy narratives that you know be you and me have come through 15 years ago with the emails cancel now a lot of people are going through that phase you know I got it might settle down down the line you know maybe 5-10 years.  people I do not see later to some of these Bay office types of misinformation but again this is there like most of the impact for misinformation is our beliefs and misinformation of pain because of top-down an attitude so whatever you know you are part of your leaders in your. Only thing that the stone is set there and the police propagate down like so again in the US like one of the biggest of the sea is Miss information that it is any of these is mostly on the right I mean obviously they left across multiple platforms across multiple studies this is consistently found that  the diet is much more is the same in Indy again like there's only one party that is that is sort of a lot of the misinformation that it is we don't have clear evidence in India but I'm Zoom like it's going to be similar or trans like in certain types of demographics what it is about being dry cleaning that makes you susceptible to do with information okay so you know yeah I getting in solving a bunch of problems I use it a lot for my work I see a lot of potential to solve a lot of problems with human intervention in the past was required now you have the sort of artificial synthetic intelligence that could discern some things for us I guess what is  what work have you done or are you doing work on that space  and where do you see long-term that helping us out in this misinformation landscape as a solution is definitely something that we have your exploring we're not there yet especially for you know a contact like like in India are contacts like WhatsApp which are which have been of the following challenges one is it's a conversation right now so if you need to understand the context and the context is very very dependent on like you know the context of the group if you and your friends are in a group you could call someone something insulting but if it's the culture of the group and its own internal joke then it's not hate speech worth it if I'm in a public forum and I called someone something so you know you did the context is very very a context-dependent that depends on who else is in that group  offline connections to them and there's no way I could back in jail in just a tad get that information right now so that's that's one leg especially if it's very hard to detect and understand contexts the other problem with a platform like WhatsApp is again we have data for this over 50% of the content is not text you again if you see your WhatsApp you will have the same kind of believe a lot of it is not just text it's you know videos images audio emojis you know. Something which is not the same as your Critter so your Facebook mostly sexual conversation again text is much much more advanced than what it is for the soda multimodal set up straight like especially if it's images that go along with the Pixar video that goes along with the text and both of these combined actually found that information rather than one of them  dr. anything again we don't have it right now it might exist in like a few years down the line but the third problem here so the first day is contact the second is Marty Modi also narcotics again it's Hindi or other law resource languages there are no it does not work as well as it works in English again people are working on traditions for this might be better we are 35 years down the line but not yeah I mean to the point of contacts I use a lot of agentic infrastructure how you screw year and I've been up agents for all sorts of things and when I use it even on a one-on-one chat or even within the agenda infrastructure it seems to hold contacts really well I guess my two cents is that it is the intelligence is at the level of a group of research assistants I I sometimes I'll say in all clean up a bunch of agents and say I want you to eat  come up with this clip for a podcast I'm I'm in this these are the parameters this is the person blah blah blah and I mean I use the cloud people advice on at which is really good write sweetheart of it or use it and these agents are used I I mean they are on par or exceed human kind of cognizance the ability to understand one's ability to serve and extra light certain pieces of data and I guess my two cents is that I I see  I'm a I'm a huge huge a I need a fan because if it helps me spin up these research assistants for variety of things I do you know artwork blogging and podcasting all these things it helps me every little context and it also understands that contextual knowledge so anyway you you are you one  this award  which is let me let me read it out here the adamic glands distinguishing which is a war can you speak to that I just saw conference on web and social media as one of the Premier conference is on social Computing Computing for social purposes and prestigious award congratulations man  yeah I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off I mean yeah it's on like your how do you use the Computing technology for social purposes like trying to sue me  I think my work specifically in the global South Arena like I think that's the that's why I actually help me get that and I guess I'm looking forward  I guess what would be your advice like  you don't people want to get into this I mean I'm looking at whatsapp Echo Chambers you know that you reference by the way can you can you describe in in very kind of plain English terms what is an what is an echo chamber chamber is it okay if you think that's where you speak something and you carry your chamber but you just hear your own voice over and over that's an echo chamber in the context of social media it's a place is a metaphor  a place where you're surrounded by people who produce ideas that are just agreeing and similar to yours right and this more and more often keep happening all social media. Just do what you do on other platforms and the reason why bring in WhatsApp and other platforms apartments on other platforms like Facebook or Twitter and so on its the more and more you know you choose to interact and engage with certain types of content and the other than that you may not necessarily choose to engage in certain type of way but if you open my YouTube feed now it's all a certain type of content and that's an echo chamber that is a Golden Sunshine Auto flicker  if you eat a lot of that but okay the group's you join the people you interact with their very limited and and this afternoon that you mentioned earlier so I if I had the choice I don't want to go and deliberately spend the limited time that I have like a spending you know if things are on things that are listening to me and I feel uncomfortable and spend my brain cycles of matter where I would just want to enjoy my mind off things that I agree with that I don't have to put a lot of mental effort into that stuff the reason why these things are okay so if I interpret what you just said it's we become susceptible to Aquitaine bus because we don't want he was a lot of cognitive resources and it's much easier to consume some  give the easy answer is something that is just kind of fast food for the Bane so to speak and I guess what is your I guess your recommendation or your how do we knock you late ourselves to be a little more critical thinking about this how do we  at a personal level how do we take responsibility from personal perspective disorder Echo chamber behavior is not dangerous in all contacts. Okay if I'm watching Cricket all the time and it's only Cricket that being recommended that's good but somehow I expect Facebook to show me more of a goal for something I don't want to do this behavior is only dangerous when it comes to large-scale political content right like we're in our society itself is never in a position  deliberate and discuss with others are not consuming information of the other side and dog and that's the area of concern but overall if you think of how much politics people can you do you know you are the information that people consume on average can you and me might be outliers Oregon Lexus something people might be outside but most people don't all the time but one thing is you have to give it to the platforms like I was just talking to someone from one of these black  do certain extent like they really over-corrected in a sense like to the fact that you know this is happening on for political science research that was done like this song called the picture of Bobble which is about the same thing you know I'll do them spitting out content that create a problem for you where you're only seeing and a lot of the big one specifically no Facebook Google does really aware of this problem and they do have these factors that ensure that people get diapers you find the piece from the A New Perspective but I got like this this two parts to this like one is the user choices like what we choose to continue and what will what will the Oculus make part of it making sure his diapers but you know it's also up to the user's heart  who is Jenna Wachtel what they want to cuz you obviously you know it's it's not an easy thing. The one chart that. It's all like just being aware of the fact that you wouldn't an echo chamber take off your choosing I think is that little sea point there like a lot of people may not even be a bad of the fact that you are you are in this chamber babe you're not getting other viewpoints right again it happens to all of us I talk to Trump is doing really bad the last one but he got like 275 million bored I got in my chamber nobody told me that you know okay it's a like 75 million people were supporting him and maybe that's how that's how the grading and talk to you then.  where you get your information from and trying to be cognizant of that I think is is already quite quite good yeah it's also requires you to expend some energy like you was mentioning earlier it's on a speaker is back on Youtube it'll be more responsible citizen thinking about the echo chamber right like the relatively I mean I know they don't lie I don't know 10 years ago or something like that which goes to show it's not a widely circulated Durham in the vernacular right we normalize Echo chamber is very normal eyes if it's in my parents Circle in their 70s 60s and 70s for them was like what do you mean Echo chamber this is this is the gospel I'm going to listen to this new source of whatever it is that's going to you know explain to me what I already know and they're going to confirm I buy it  I got to be people who have similar belief systems means have similar political views of me I think the scale platform in used Echo Chambers are difficult things and I think it's just being a bear off and you having the exercise having too excited that you know saying okay  dispatch from this particular Source let me just try to diversify just acknowledge I think it's enough like I think that's really helping me to get I guess I'll ask you a personal question so illiteracy is a big problem India last time I check the statistics it was something like close to seventy percent was the literacy rate in India something like that so nearly a third of India is unable to read and things like that they watching be there probably consuming videos of pictures of what it would have you I mean that is a mountain of a problem by itself right and you talk about digital literacy and stuff like that like that's a far Milestone one of the I mean I guess how does this kind of rank in terms of like how do we do we prioritize just basic literacy to begin with and the other problem  we've got this kind of multilingual landscape right like in so you know you could you could be bombarded in various languages and how do you know how do you translate these things in various languages it's a very compounding kind of a problem in India at me I'm sure you've thought about this so this is the last generation right next to that we can actually fix educate at skin so a lot of the digital literacy initiatives like I guess I defy electricity by age group has much doing much better I mean there's so much money being spent on all these International Education Mission and so I'm so close to ninety percent or so below 18  a lot of money on that but they're not really learning a lot so the quality of Education that people get is really really low so I'm officially government School in the Public Instruction school that's that's a huge huge Jasper India that needs to be fixed like but if you can incorporate these sorts of issues off like okay it's a little C I didn't get quickly embraced technology and you don't know how they're really trying to teach kids how to type instead of writing in cursive. They I think they really move very fast and do things and probably to take a decade or so for a country like India to catch up but we need to have policy that insurance  these things are taught from make your childhood like you do from your primary school so that you can actually stop it now listen to see because once his kids are at a certain level in school they're already going to start using technology and so that's all become a part of life now so you can actually escaped that so it should be definitely doing calculus to school okay see you then or maybe my last question I know you were time is is is premium how much do you work with like these big big name companies in Silicon Valley and other companies that create a suicide or directly interacting with these people I guess what is your experience with that with working with that how open are they could they also have to be in a balanced business interests versus you do Mass adoption of these of these platforms and Swan Lake  yeah yeah so I guess you know my views on this are slightly I'm very very sympathetic to the platforms and the baby need to make decisions I don't think they're the villains have a believe that your disbelief that they are somehow the villain to lead our people to Echo Chambers or leading to our team's getting in or whatever like that's a pretty misconceived believe I mean requires a lot of decisions right like where you cannot optimized for 10 people and there's always going to be the start of education has been those kind of things happen but overall I think they're very responsible and try to be  well I guess this believe in life make very widespread Mike my personal belief is that there are a lot of people in a lot of these companies that do genuinely care and it's not it's not binary like you cannot say OK their backs amazing profit so that's why people are saying this if it does not work that we are obviously there's so much so many dimensions year they have to somehow worked with regulatory pressures that would work with their bureaucratic a different am that they have to balance and it comes to you know when you're obviously can they do better yet they can do better be really trying to really make things worse definitely not like my personal interactions a lot of people in these,  really gives me that hope that it's not just that binary thing where they're engaging The Profit maximizing profit so that ignoring a lot of this I think it's as much more in the middle so they have the letters over the algorithm right and like what I'm hearing you're saying is that they have levels of the other than they are good actors they doing their best to counterbalance all of these things  but you know what you see in like other podcast or conspiracy theorists or you know people who have a ax to grind with the social media companies is that oh there they do not with the map to just throw it at me. You is the easy notion right. That is absolutely false like it's a regular tree  for that matter if they really are knowingly doing this are tuning to somehow cause harm I don't think they're finding loopholes which are just three wrong but legally acceptable in a babe are you don't maybe they'll let go towards the specific thing that occupies the profits rather than this notion that social media guys have a dial in the algorithm and they're tuning it it doesn't work that way I mean that you can do it again like I said any balance you do like to do certain type of ham with ham  other types of people there's no one steady state where this is beneficial for all of them and it's also not just the algorithm there's a lot of human choices that are involved in this a lot of people themselves are Bad actors are deliberately or not like you choosing to consume certain type of content or certain type of your post certain type of food does a lot of this that they have to balance and it's very very very difficult if not impossible to find this fine balance with everything is all you know sunny and nice that's impossible so I think that's a very wrong notion that these guys were trying to maximize profit might happen I'm not saying it's not happening but it's not like I don't know what happens in 1% of the cases it's not the majority  okay okay well that opens my eyes up a little bit I mean I had this very cynical view that you know it's a profit-maximizing machine these Google's and faithful to the world if they don't they don't care as long as you know they can straddle the line of being legal legally acceptable they're going to take that line and ethical have Epix to go out the window what I'm hearing you saying is that day absolutely try to be on the ethical side of these questions are these like in a morally you no gray area you know kind of areas where they don't they're not bad actors did find the best but I think I think then the  the takeaway I see personally is that it's a multi-pronged effort like we have to society also engage ourselves to educate ourselves to rid ourselves of misinformation by season so on behalf  attacked us from like you know critical thinking perspective like how do we teach our kids to not fall for certain kinds of narratives and so on at the same time we doing up all the levels on the technical side that's that's the only way we're going to tackle this is there is no one-size-fits-all solution is no magic bullet here as it is you know they are evil platform that is responsible for a lot of these been near everything was move fast and break things and they realize that the baby that is coming that's going to get them to jail so they don't want to do it anymore maybe back in the day but it's not like that anymore like you so much more to talk to any of these big platform and the Big Lots on the other one that.  have the most impact really quick can you speak about that RWC score I found it very interesting how you could recommend some kind of content do people with opposing views and stuff can you talk to that how do people get out of there Echo chamber say it again one of the findings that we had was obviously you know if you are on a Spectra X2 if you are an extreme right person you wouldn't want to be recommended something on the extreme left and you I want we may want to be on the on the center if you're on the center maybe it's okay for you to see something more than the extreme of the other side just to broaden your perspective and so on so he kind of operation is this mathematically the network connections between used  and then the flow of information as a random walk on that Network basically it's a it's a lot of water really really part of this to all over in all networks nature liquid asset to Google page back is basically just a random walk on a network that gives you the sort of like you doing on a walk. So the property of the sound of walk the basic TV do something like that and then be the command People based on this all around the block and that has certain properties in seeing these are usually in a well-known popular people from the other side with a certain type of suggestions from the other side.  a great service to humanity as I see it keep doing what you're doing man I appreciate your time and your knowledge and let me know however I could be a future use to you I will absolutely try my best to amplify your voice how ever I can I won't spread misinformation I'll be as good looking as possible to visit illiteracy I guess so thank you very much too thank you so much talk to you later
